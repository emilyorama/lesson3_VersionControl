            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Prior to this course, I had no idea what a version control system was, however I am glad I learned since this system is often used in the workforce. A VCS remembers and documents changes to files over time, allowing the user to return to those previously edited files. The different changed files are classified as “versions” and kept in the version database; for example, version 3 is the third edited change of the file. This course introduces version control systems in order to expose us to the filing systems that will likely be used in this field of work, so we will be somewhat prepared and experienced.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system used by many companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Netflix. This system stores data in a more resourceful manner than other systems—it stores the files in a fashion similar to “a stream of snapshots,” rather than storing the files in a list of changes. The technique used promotes Git from just a VSC, to a complex and organized filing system accompanied by many tools for people to easily use. Git is a great example of a popular VCS used by large companies, and it interests me because I am looking to go into the website design field, where Git, or a similar program, will likely be used.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">How Is a VCS Beneficial?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Have you ever had a mental breakdown because you accidentally overwrote a file? Well, with a VCS, you don’t have to worry about that (or the mental breakdown). The different versions of that file will be stored in a repository where your original file is safe. If you need to go back to an old file or change the file back to the original, the system will allow you to do so. A VCS also allows people to edit the same file at the same time without any problems, which is helpful in a work environment. I find this interesting because there have been many times when I have worked on a project and messed up, and wasn’t able to return back to the original once I saved it.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What Is a Repository?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository stores files, and in this case, all changes to the files. There are two different types of repositories in a version control system: remote and local. A remote repository is on a remote server that multiple people with access share. A local repository is on a machine belonging to an individual person. Both however share the same purpose which is to store versions of edited files. Before this lesson, I was unaware I had never seen the word repository, nor knew what it meant. Thankfully, I now know what it is, and will be prepared when it is brought up at a job or internship.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Life Without VCS</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Without VCS, people would typically save different versions of their file by titling them by the date or different names for each version. This is a lot more work and a lot harder to keep track of, since this method is very unorganized and unhelpful. VCS is interesting to me because I usually save a bunch of files, sometimes just the original, just in case I want to go back. This course provides an easy way to track and revert back to old versions of a file, making life in this class so much easier in the case of a mess-up.</p>
