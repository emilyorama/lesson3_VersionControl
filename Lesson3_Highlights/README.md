## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A virtual control system remembers and documents changes to files over time, allowing the user to return to those previously edited files. The different changed files are classified as “versions” and kept in the version database. 
2. Git is a version control system used by many companies and stores data in a more resourceful manner than other systems
3. A repository stores files, and in this case, all changes to the files. There are two different types of repositories in a version control system: remote and local.
